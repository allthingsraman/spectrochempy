abstract = {A completely model-free method for the resolution of overlapping chromatographic peaks is presented. Evolving factor analysis enhances the power of classical factor analysis by exploiting the additional information contained in the response data through the intrinsic order of the elution time. The results are the elution profiles and the normalized spectra of the components.}
